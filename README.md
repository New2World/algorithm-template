# Algorithms

Algorithms for solving ACM/ICPC problems. Instead of writing some templates, which may not be easy to understand, they are used to solve some concrete problems. For some data structures and algorithms (like quick sort and red-black tree), there are some really efficient implements (like STL), I will just put them down to remind me how they work. Some simple structures like stack and queue will not be included.
